# GraphQL and ExtReact Tech Talk

## Running

If you haven't already, log into Sencha's private registry using the credentials you received in your ExtReact trial or subscription activation email.  If you don't have credentials, you can get them by [signing up for a trial of ExtReact](https://www.sencha.com/products/extreact/evaluate/).

```
npm login --registry=http://npm.sencha.com --scope=@extjs
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then, run the Apollo example:

```
npm run apollo
```

Or, run the relay example:

```
npm run relay
```
